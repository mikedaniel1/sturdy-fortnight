        A Brief History of ECMAScript Versions in JavaScript
    </h1>
    <h3 style="font-size: 1.7rem;">
        Introduction
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20.5px;">
        As a programming language, JavaScript is widely used in web development for creating interactive and dynamic
        user interfaces. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 under the name Mocha, which was later changed to
        LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript. <br><br>

        The ECMAScript standard is developed and maintained by Ecma International, a Swiss-based standards organization,
        and it is officially designated as ECMA-262. This standard serves as the foundation of JavaScript, and its
        versions directly influence the development and evolution of the language. In this article, we'll provide an
        overview of the ECMAScript evolution, offering insights into some of the key updates in each version.
    </p>
    <h1 style="font-size: 2rem;">
        ECMAScript 1 (1997)
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20.5px;">
        ECMAScript 1, also known as ES1, was the first version of the ECMAScript standard and was released in 1997. It was based on the JavaScript language and included features such as variables, functions, and basic control flow statements.
    </p>
    <h1 style="font-size: 2rem;">
        ECMAScript 2 (1998)
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20.5px;">
        ECMAScript 2, also known as ES2, was the second version of the ECMAScript standard and was released in 1998. It made minor changes to the language and mainly focused on making the standard more consistent.
    </p>
    <h1 style="font-size: 2rem;">
        ECMAScript 3 (1999)
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20.5px;">
        ECMAScript 3, also known as ES3, was the third version of the ECMAScript standard and was released in 1999. It introduced several important features such as regular expressions, try-catch statements, and improved string handling.
    </p>
    <h1 style="font-size: 2rem;">
        ECMAScript 4 (Never Released)
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20.5px;">
        ECMAScript 4 was planned to be the fourth version of the ECMAScript standard, but it was never released. It was intended to introduce significant changes to the language, including classes, interfaces, and namespaces. However, the proposal faced significant opposition, and the development was ultimately abandoned.
    </p>
    <h1 style="font-size: 2rem;">
        ECMAScript 5 (2009)
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20.5px;">
        ECMAScript 5, also known as ES5, was the fifth version of the ECMAScript standard and was released in 2009. It introduced several important features such as strict mode, JSON support, and improved array manipulation.
    </p>
    <h1 style="font-size: 2rem;">
        ECMAScript 5.1 (2011)
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20.5px;">
        ECMAScript 5.1, also known as ES5.1, was a minor update to ECMAScript 5 and was released in 2011. It mostly focused on making the standard more consistent and correcting errors.
    </p>
    <h1 style="font-size: 2rem;">
        ECMAScript 6 (2015)
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20.5px;">
        ECMAScript 6, also known as ES6, was the sixth version of the ECMAScript standard and was released in 2015. It introduced several important features such as <i>let</i> and <i>const</i>, arrow functions, template literals, and classes.
